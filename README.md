# compute_primes

Compute the number and sum of all primes in a from 0 to a max range.

## build

build a binary with `make build`

## Usage

Count and sum all primes between 0 and *max prime*.

Run the binary with `./compute_primes <num threads> <max prime>`

OR

Run the file with `go run . <num threads> <max prime>`

where `max primes` is the upper end of the range you'd like to find primes within.
